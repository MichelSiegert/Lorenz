This processing piece mostly is my work on Lorenz Attractors: I am doing this to generate Data, to figure out "stable" version of the Lorenz attractors ( those that do not go off to infinity).
I am continuing to create visuals with this until there are no interesting visualizations of this left. 

The Value.txt contains all stable versions of the Lorenz attractor that I have found so far.
